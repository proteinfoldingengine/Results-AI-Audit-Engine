UQCF-GEM Phase 46.8 Integrator Validation Release

Overview

Phase 46.8 completes the second stage of the UQCF-GEM Quantum Compute Simulation Roadmap — validating integrator stability and precision gates across quantum–classical boundaries.
All five validation audits (A–E) have passed, confirming that the numerical integrator preserves physical invariants and precision coherence through machine-epsilon limits.

🧠 Interpretation

This release demonstrates Δt² energy and variance scaling, machine-precision fidelity, and stable V/I normalization across a preregistered k-grid (2.2×10² → 1.9×10¹⁰ Mpc⁻¹).
It finalizes Milestone III: Integrator Stability Across Quantum–Classical Boundary, enabling transition to Phase 47 — Decoherence Window and Fractional Propagator.

⸻

🧾 Reproducibility
	•	Deterministic environment variables and RNG seed are included in the release script.
	•	Run phase46_8_integrator_validation.py on CPU or GPU; verify identical CONFIG HASH (dcef8259998f).
	•	Expected run time: ~8 s grid evaluation.

🚀 Next Phase — 47.x “Decoherence Window”

Objective: Extend the validated Strang integrator into fractional and stochastic regimes.
	•	Add Γ(t) decoherence coupling and fractional step (½ + iε) propagator.
	•	Track κ′ stability under noise floor and test quantum decoherence scaling.
	•	Target Q ∈ {10, 12} for extended validation.
