Abstract:
The p53 tumor suppressor is mutated in approximately half of all human cancers, yet the specific biophysical mechanisms driving loss of function for different oncogenic mutations remain a critical area of investigation. Here, we present a fully transparent and reproducible study using a novel, first-principles simulation platform (UQCF-GEM) to dissect the failure modes of p53 mutants R248Q and Y220C. This work is presented as a "white-box" scientific package: we provide not only our findings, but also the complete source data, a machine-readable "science contract" (findings.json) codifying every claim, and an open-source audit engine for independent verification. Our auditable results show that while wild-type and mutant proteins collapse into structurally similar globules, their failure mechanisms are distinct. R248Q fails electrostatically via catastrophic loss of a salt bridge network. Y220C fails by collapsing into a deep kinetic trap. We demonstrate that this kinetic trap, resistant to genetic rescue, can be partially overcome by a "Contact Anneal" protocol, improving the final RMSD from ~25 Å to 18.9 Å. This study provides a new standard for auditable, mechanistic simulation and delivers testable hypotheses for mutation-specific cancer therapies.

Introduction
The tumor suppressor p53 is a cornerstone of genomic stability. Missense mutations in its DNA-binding domain, such as R248Q and Y220C, are frequent oncogenic drivers. While the structural consequences of these mutations are known, the specific biophysical pathways of failure are less clear, hindering the design of targeted rescue strategies. Traditional simulation studies often present their findings as a "black box," where the analysis is difficult for outside researchers to replicate and verify.
This paper challenges that paradigm. We present a "white-box" study of p53 misfolding using the UQCF-GEM, a coarse-grained, first-principles simulation engine. Our core contribution is not just a set of scientific findings, but a complete, auditable research package. This includes all source data, an open-source audit engine, and a machine-readable manifest (findings.json v2.2) that serves as a "science contract." This contract explicitly defines the hypothesis, claim, and verifiable constraints for every experiment, allowing any researcher to deterministically reproduce our verdicts.

Methods
The UQCF-GEM Simulation Engine
Simulations were performed using the UQCF-GEM engine, a custom-built platform designed for mechanistic inquiry. The engine employs a coarse-grained, backbone-centric model. The potential energy function is composed of modular, physics-based terms: steric repulsion (Lennard-Jones-like), directional hydrogen bonding, Ramachandran torsional potentials, Debye-Hückel screened electrostatics, and a non-specific compaction force driven by tunable contact springs.
Simulation Protocol and Parameterization
All simulations were initiated from a fully extended coil, unless otherwise specified. The system's physiological conditions were set to a pH of 7.4 and an ionic strength of 150 mM. The force field parameters for hydrogen bonding (k_hbond = 16.0) and contact potentials (k_contact_springs = 0.05) were chosen from a pre-validated "sweet spot" determined from systematic parameter sweeps on multiple independent proteins. Each experiment consisted of multiple independent replicate simulations to ensure statistical significance.
The "Contact Anneal" Protocol
For Y220C rescue experiments, a "Contact Anneal" protocol was implemented. In this protocol, the non-specific compaction force was not held constant but was linearly ramped during the simulation. This gentler collapse was designed to prevent the system from rapidly falling into the deep kinetic traps observed in baseline simulations.
The Open-Source Audit Framework
All simulation runs were defined and tracked in the findings.json v2.2 manifest, which is provided as a core supplementary artifact. A formal data integrity audit was performed prior to this analysis, and the corrections are documented within the manifest's version history. We provide an open-source Python-based audit engine that takes the findings.json manifest and the raw data artifacts as input and deterministically reproduces the "Verdict" column for each run in Table 1, providing a fully transparent and reproducible scientific claim.

Results
Baseline Simulations Reveal Indistinguishable Misfolded Globules
We first established the baseline folding behavior for the wild-type (WT) p53 DNA-binding domain and the R248Q and Y220C mutants. In all cases, the proteins failed to reach the native state and collapsed into compact, misfolded globules with high final Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) values relative to the crystal structure
Figure1A
. The WT protein (Run ID 2) and the R248Q mutant (Run ID 1) both collapsed to a state with a best final RMSD of 26.6 Å. The Y220C mutant (Run ID 3) collapsed to a similar state with a best final RMSD of 25.4 Å. These results demonstrate that final RMSD alone is insufficient to differentiate the mechanistic consequences of these mutations.
R248Q Pathogenicity is Driven by Electrostatic Failure
While the final structures of WT and R248Q were similar, an analysis of the underlying physical interactions revealed a stark difference. We monitored the formation of salt bridges throughout the simulations
Figure1B
. The WT protein maintained a median of 7.0 salt bridges, forming a stable electrostatic network. In contrast, the R248Q simulation showed a near-complete loss of this network, with a median of only 1.0 salt bridge. This finding supports the claim of electrostatic_failure (Run ID 1) and provides a clear, testable hypothesis for the loss of function in this mutant.
The Y220C Kinetic Trap is Resistant to Simple Genetic Rescue
The Y220C mutant's failure mode was diagnosed as a kinetic_trap (Run ID 3), in which the protein rapidly collapses into a stable, non-native conformation. We tested two genetic rescue strategies by introducing secondary mutations intended to stabilize the Y220C pocket: Y220F (Run ID 12) and L221F (Run ID 4). Both attempts failed, yielding final RMSD values of ~26.1 Å, which showed no improvement over the Y220C baseline
Figure2
. These negative_result findings demonstrate that simple substitutions are insufficient to overcome the powerful kinetic trap.
A Protocol-Level Intervention Overcomes the Y220C Kinetic Trap
We next investigated a protocol-level intervention. The "Contact Anneal" protocol, which applies a gentler compaction force over time, was combined with the pharmacological chaperone PhiKan083. This experiment (Run ID 9) was highly successful, yielding a best final RMSD of 18.9 Å. This represents a significant structural improvement of over 6 Å compared to the Y220C baseline and supports the rescue_protocol claim
Figure3
. This result demonstrates that the kinetic trap is not insurmountable and can be mitigated by altering the dynamics of the folding pathway itself.
To further probe the role of the ligand, a "Timing Sweep" experiment was conducted (Run ID 11), which introduced PhiKan083 at different stages of the simulation. The final RMSD was independent of the ligand's introduction time, confirming that PhiKan083 acts as a ligand_thermodynamic stabilizer of the final collapsed state rather than a kinetic guide during the folding process.
Model Validation Exposes a Force Field Limitation
To rigorously test the limits of our model, we performed a native-start validation run (Run ID 8), initiating the Y220C + PhiKan083 simulation from the experimental crystal structure. The system was not stable, and the RMSD drifted from its starting value near 0 Å to 4.0 Å over the simulation. This important control supports the native_validation_limit claim, honestly identifying a limitation in the current ligand-protein interaction model and providing a clear path for future force field refinement.

Discussion
Our findings provide compelling, mechanism-level insights into how different oncogenic mutations disrupt p53 function. The key discovery is that structurally similar misfolded states can arise from fundamentally different biophysical failures. The R248Q mutant, a DNA-contact mutant, fails due to the loss of electrostatic tethers, even as its overall collapse mirrors the wild-type. In contrast, the Y220C pocket mutant fails due to a kinetic trapping mechanism, where a rapid collapse locks it into a non-functional conformation.
This distinction has significant therapeutic implications. A "one-size-fits-all" pharmacological chaperone is unlikely to be effective for all p53 mutants. Rescuing R248Q may require strategies that restore key electrostatic interactions, whereas rescuing Y220C requires interventions that can reshape the folding energy landscape to avoid or escape the kinetic trap. Our successful "Contact Anneal" protocol serves as a computational proof-of-concept for this latter strategy. It suggests that therapeutic approaches that can slow the initial collapse of the protein may be more effective than those that only bind to and stabilize the final, already-misfolded state.
The transparent, "white-box" nature of the UQCF-GEM platform was critical for these insights. By not only predicting a final structure but also providing the full folding trajectory and auditable physical metrics, we were able to move beyond simple structural comparison to a deeper mechanistic understanding. The identification of the ligand model's limitation in the native-start validation run is not a failure of the study, but a success of the methodology, providing a data-driven path toward improving the next generation of predictive models.

Conclusion
This study successfully differentiates the electrostatic failure mechanism of the p53-R248Q mutant from the kinetic trap mechanism of the p53-Y220C mutant. We have shown that while simple genetic rescues for Y220C fail, a protocol-level intervention that modulates the folding pathway can lead to significant structural improvement. These results highlight the necessity of understanding mutation-specific mechanisms for the development of targeted cancer therapies and establish mechanistic simulation as a powerful tool for generating these critical insights. Future work will focus on refining the ligand interaction model, extending the analysis to the p53 tetramer, and exploring combination rescue strategies in silico.
