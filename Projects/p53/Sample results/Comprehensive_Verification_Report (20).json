The reported RMSD of approximately zero in the `best_run_details/comprehensive_report_p53_Y220C_PhiKan083_RESCUE_FINAL_Ct0p05_HB16p0_Lig4p0_s3.png` is highly suspicious and indicative of a simulation artifact. This suspicion is further corroborated by the analysis of the trajectory file (`best_run_details/trajectory_p53_Y220C_PhiKan083_RESCUE_FINAL_Ct0p05_HB16p0_Lig4p0_s3.pdb`), which reveals identical CA atom coordinates across all sampled frames.  This is highly unusual for a genuine MD trajectory and points towards a problem with the simulation or frame extraction process. The constant RMSD and Rg values throughout the simulation, as reported in `best_run_details/diagnostics_timeseries_p53_Y220C_PhiKan083_RESCUE_FINAL_Ct0p05_HB16p0_Lig4p0_s3.csv`, reinforce the likelihood of an artifact.
